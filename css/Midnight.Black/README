Midnight Black - A jPlayer Skin
Quite a while ago, I found this great jPlayer skin on GitHub. It was nice, simple, and great looking! But what I soon found out was that it was only for jPlayer 2.0.0. That got me thinking, "Hey! Why don't I update it?!". And I did just that!

The orginal theme for jPlayer 2.0.0 can be found here - https://github.com/persand/jPlayer-skins
